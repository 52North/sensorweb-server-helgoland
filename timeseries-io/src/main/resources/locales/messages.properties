# add new or adjust localized messages can be done by dropping them into WEB-INF/classes/locales folder

# localization file is read as UTF-8

# Note that some IDEs (like eclipse) save and open properties files as 
# ISO-8859-1 by default! If you need characters beyond this set of 
# character encoding, either make changes in an external editor (like 
# notepad++) or escape every non-ISO-8859-1 character (for example 
# zur\u00EF\u00BF\u00BDck instead of zurück).
